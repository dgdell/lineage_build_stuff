Subject: [PATCH 05/11] selinux: move vendor_camera_prop from
 device/qcom/sepolicy

Snap wants to read vendor specific camera props which are not just a qcom thing.
To be able to grant Snap the right to read those props without breaking non-qcom devices
the definition for vendor_camera_prop should be moved to global lineage ruleset.
