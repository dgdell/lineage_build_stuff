Subject: [PATCH 105/206] Camera2: Prevent propogating CancelAutoFocus during
 Video Recording

When AutoFocus is started during Video Recording, CancelAutoFocus
is called after KEY_FOCUS_TIME seconds. CancelAutoFocus has the
side effect of resetting the sensor AF position and will result in
instant loss of focus which is not a desired event when AF is
manually triggered in case of Video Recording.
