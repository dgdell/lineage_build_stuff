Subject: [PATCH 123/172] Protect against multiple shutter callbacks per frame
 in longshot mode.

Some devices send multiple shutter callbacks for one captured frame in
longshot mode. As this causes mismatch between the calculated number of
captured frames and the calculated number of JPEGs received for those,
which in turn leads to longshot mode never being ended properly,
protect against that scenario by discarding all but the first callback.
