Subject: [PATCH 16/18] SystemUI: disable wallpaper-based tint for scrim

This is quite annoying especially when the lockscreen is displaying an album art.
You don't really want to see the green of your amazing wallpaper
picturing a gorgerous forest landscape when you're rocking Master of Puppets.

Also several users and contributors complained about this thing.
Also it was removed in P dp1 and it never came back in later P builds.
