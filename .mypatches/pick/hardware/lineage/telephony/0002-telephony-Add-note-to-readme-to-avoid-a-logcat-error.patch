+To include this jar in your builds, you must add qti-telephony-common to PRODUCT_PACKAGES and add telephony-ext to PRODUCT_BOOT_JARS. While it is not strictly necessary, telephony-ext can be added to PRODUCT_PACKAGES to avoid some harmless errors in the log buffer. For devices not using qcom sepolicy, extphone must be labelled as u:object_r:radio_service:s0 in the device's private platform selinux service contexts.
