Note that the suggestion to use PPA openjdk-r is outdated (the PPA has never updated their offering of openjdk-7-jdk, so it lacks security fixes); skip that answer even if it is the most upvoted.

 All devices should have a list of proprietary blobs in their device tree called ```proprietary-files.txt```.  This list is used to create the vendor repository for building the device by extracting blobs from a device running the latest copy of LineageOS and/or from a system dump.  Generally devices need only one list of blobs although you may encounter devices that have both ```proprietary-files.txt``` and ```proprietary-files-qc.txt``` (or more).  There is no need to split the files and the reason for the split is largely historical at this point.
