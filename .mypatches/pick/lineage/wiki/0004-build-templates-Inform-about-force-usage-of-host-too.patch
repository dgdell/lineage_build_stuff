+### Forcebly use host tools
+
+In some cases, in order to avoid compilation errors, the host tools must be used instead of the prebuilts provided in the source code.
+
+For Ubuntu version 18.04 (bionic), host flex must be used. You can run:
+
+```
+export USE_HOST_FLEX=yes
+```
+
+or simply add that line to your `~/.bashrc` file.
