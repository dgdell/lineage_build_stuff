 ## Where does the updater app store the downloaded zip?
  - `/data/lineageos_updates/`
+
+## Mirrors? Why don't you use torrents? Or IPFS? Or carrier pigeons?
+ - This question isn't new. To list a few reasons:
+   - A majority of builds are downloaded on mobile devices via our updater. Mobile devices have limited bandwidth and monthly quotas.
+   - Bandwidth is plentiful for open source projects. We have roughly 100gbit available to us.
+   - We occsassionally need to remove a build becasue of a device-breaking bug. This is much harder, or impossible, to accomplish with torrents.
+   - We currently keep the last 4 builds per device. Older builds do not have the latest security patches.
+   - The top 5 devices account for 50% of our users. 95% of our builds do not have enough users to justify torrents.
+   - Pigeons are slow and stupid. They also tend to be hit by vehicles and make a declious treat for predators. We could send your build via pigeon, but chances are very slim it would make it to you.
