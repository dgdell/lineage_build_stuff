    - You are trying to install a build for a different device. _You need to make sure you download the zip for the correct device *and* variant_
    - You are attempting to migrate from an unofficial build to official LineageOS. _A full data wipe is needed if you are coming from something other than an official build of LineageOS._
    - Your vendor/modem/bootloader is too old (or maybe too new). _Flash the correct stock image for your device, before wiping data and attempting to install LineageOS again_. This information should be listed on the device's wiki page.
+   - Your recovery is outdated. _Flash the newest available version of the recommended recovery image for your device_.
  - If your error still persists after confirming these are not causing your issue, ask someone for help IRC (#lineageos@freenode) or on the [Subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/lineageos) and provide a recovery log.
 
 ## My device _is_ officially supported, but there's no zips for it on the download page. Where are they?
