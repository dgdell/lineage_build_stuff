 Once the mirror is synced you can then run `repo init -u /path/to/mirror/LineageOS/android.git -b $BRANCHNAME` and sync normally.
 
 If you want to sync the source quickly but want it to be up-to-date without syncing the mirror every time, then run `repo init -u http://www.github.com/LineageOS/android -b $BRANCHNAME --reference=/path/to/mirror/`.
