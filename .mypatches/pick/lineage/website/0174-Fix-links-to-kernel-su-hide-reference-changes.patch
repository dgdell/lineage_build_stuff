@@ -44,7 +44,7 @@ We've created a kernel patch that hides the existence of su from _all_ processes
 
 This effectively makes it _impossible_ for unprivileged processes to exploit su when it is disabled in settings. Indeed, it makes it impossible to even see that the su binary exists. It cannot be seen either directly (via `stat /system/xbin/su`) or indirectly (via `ls /system/xbin`). A side effect of this, is that Play Services can't detect su binary when root is disabled either, allowing some (older) devices to pass SafetyNet when root is installed but disabled.
 
-This fix cannot be applied globally but _must_ be merged to each device's kernel. If your device hasn't been patched yet, or you're maintaining a device, take the proper patch and apply it _as soon as possible_ (kernel [3.18](https://review.lineageos.org/170648), [3.10](https://review.lineageos.org/170624) and [3.4](https://review.lineageos.org/170684)).
