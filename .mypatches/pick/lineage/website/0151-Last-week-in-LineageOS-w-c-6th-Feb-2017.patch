+Lots of people have been asking for changelogs, so we'll be making one for people who don't want to trawl through Gerrit.
+If you want to know everything that's changed in the last week or so, check [our Gerrit](https://review.lineageos.org). We will refrain from adding changes for each device, as this would take too much time. Instead, things that have changed for everybody, new devices added to the roster, or __major__ changes to devices (eg cm13->cm14.1, or massive breaking bug has been fixed) will be reported.
+
+## What's changed then?
+* Removed AOSP Soundrecorder and CyanogenMod Screen Recorder, which have been replaced with our homegrown app, dubbed "Recorder". This handles both sound and screen recording
+* ~~CM~~ Lineage Wallpapers have returned
+* New touchscreen gestures interface for devices that support it with customizable actions
+* A new website design, courtesy of [Aykut Yilmaz](https://review.lineageos.org/#/c/160330/)
+
+It really doesn't look like much, but _lots_ of changes are happening, but most are behind the scenes things, and little edge bug fixes
+
+## Build roster
+Added 14.1 devices
+
+* Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 (Wi-Fi) (2016) (Snapdragon) – gts28vewifi
