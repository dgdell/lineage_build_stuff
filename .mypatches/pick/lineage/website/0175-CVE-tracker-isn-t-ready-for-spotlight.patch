-### CVE tracker
-
-If you didn't know, Google releases a set of security updates monthly, which fix a number of CVEs (security vulnerabilities). These aren't always in the upper layers of Android, and are typically in the kernel.
-
-Because of this, it can be difficult to record exactly which devices, as a developer, have been patched against particular vulnerabilities. Our [CVE tracker](https://cve.lineageos.org), which was previously private is now publically accessible (as read-only), primarily for the use of developers not currently part of the Lineage team who would like to patch their kernels against security vulnerabilities.

 ### Gello and Jelly
 
 [Last month](https://www.lineageos.org/Changelog-8), we introduced a new browser app, codenamed Jelly, made for devices that couldn't handle a heavier browser such as Gello and/or Chrome.
