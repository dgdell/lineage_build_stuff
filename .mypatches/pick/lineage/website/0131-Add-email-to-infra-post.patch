   * Minimum 500GB storage space. 
   * As a note, we'd prefer non-capped connections with static IPs, and they must be in some sort of professional hosting company (ie, datacenter, colocation facility, ISP, university, etc). While we appreciate the offers from people with gigabit at home, it's slightly too hard to manage.

 As a reminder: we have not started doing official builds yet.
