+
+While the project's development proceeds, we think it's important to take a moment and get some feedback from our users. 
+It has been decided to create a simple survey, instead of collecting on-device metrics, to help us improve LineageOS 
+in the right direction without wasting resources on things that our userbase is not interested in. 
+
+The survey is really simple and we won't collect any sensitive information. 
+
+We kindly ask you to be respectful of everyone: be honest and don't take the survey more than one time, each one's opinion is equally important. 
+
+The survey will be closed in two weeks' time. 
+
+
+### Topics 
+
+We've divided this survey into 5 topics:
+
+1. Apps
+2. Wallpapers
+3. Features
+4. Infrastructure
+5. Public relations
+
+
+You can take the survey here below, and you can share it to your friends using this link: [goo.gl/forms/4phLuXIWHUr3s4Qf2](https://goo.gl/forms/4phLuXIWHUr3s4Qf2) 
+
+We're looking forward to see your answers!
+
+The LineageOS team
