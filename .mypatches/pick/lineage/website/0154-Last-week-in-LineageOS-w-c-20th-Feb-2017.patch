+## Welcome to LineageOS' weekly review, where we go over changes in the past week
+
+### Major changes since 20th February 2017
+
+* Support for more than 2 cameras in Snap ([#154734](http://review.lineageos.org/#/c/154734))
+* Settings > Accounts not showing accounts has been fixed ([#162969](http://review.lineageos.org/#/c/162969))
+* The work required to maintain CMFM is substantial, and on review, it was a better investment of time to change managers. The AOSP file manager (with some added extras) is its replacement ([nuke_cmfm](http://review.lineageos.org/#/q/topic:nuke_cmfm))
+* Automatic Do Not Disturb rules are fixed, so you don't pestered during the night or in meetings ([#162968](http://review.lineageos.org/#/c/162968))
+* Dual SIM UI improvements in Dialer for DSDA devices ([#161227](http://review.lineageos.org/#/c/161227))
+* Our download page built-in changelog now supports a frequently asked for feature: filtering out "Automatic translation imports" ([#162852](http://review.lineageos.org/#/c/162852))
+
+### Translation
+
+Bilingual? Trilingual? Anythinglingual?
+If you think you can help translate LineageOS to a different language, jump over to [Crowdin](http://crowdin.com/project/lineageos) and have a go!
+Only do this if you are reasonably literate in the target language; poor translations waste both our and your time. 
+
+### Signing problems
+
+With the CAF rebase, one of the tools required for signing was moved. As such, some builds were incorrectly signed and pulled as soon as we were made aware.
+Future problems like this should be noticed a lot quicker going forward thanks to the changes to our build process (more on that below). 
+
+### February Security Patches
+
+They've been merged! ([#160504](https://review.lineageos.org/#/c/160504/) - plus a 'force' push to updated branches, which means they aren't shown in Gerrit)
+
+Sorry they've taken so long, we had some unexpected issues with this, as well as it being stalled until we rebased on CAF. 
+Future security updates will be able to be merged more quickly
+
+### Build roster
+
+Builds this week (and weeks to come) will be split evenly across Monday to Friday to reduce load on the build servers and build mirrors.
+This also means we can check breaking errors much more quickly, rather than having to pull 30 builds on the first day. 
+
+Added 14.1 devices
+
+* LG G3 (AT&T) - d850
+* LG G3 (Korea) - f400
+* Samsung Galaxy S III (GSM LTE) - i9305
+
+Added 13.0 devices
+
+* LeEco LeMax2 - x2
+* Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 (GSM) - n5100
+* Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 (Wi-Fi) - n5110
+* Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 (LTE) - n5120
